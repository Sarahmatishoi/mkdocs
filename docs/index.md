MkDocs Syntax
MkDocs are written in Markdown.

File layout
When creating files, ensure that mkdocs.yml is outside the docs folder.

The docs folder is where all content files are located with the main page titled index.md

Content
Every file inside the docs folder uses the Markdown language where:

Headings `are writen using '#' and only one symbolizes the largest heading
Jumping to the next line requires you to skip a line within the file.

Different pages can also be linked inside another document.
